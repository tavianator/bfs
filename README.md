`bfs`
=====

Breadth-first search for your files.

`bfs` is a variant of the UNIX `find` command that operates [breadth-first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) rather than [depth-first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search).
It is otherwise intended to be [compatible](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/issues/6) with GNU `find`.
If you're not familiar with `find`, have a look at the [GNU find manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_mono/find.html) to get acquainted first.


Breadth vs. depth
-----------------

The advantage of breadth-first over depth first search is that it usually finds the file(s) you're looking for faster.
Imagine the following directory tree:

<pre>
haystack
├── deep
│   └── 1
│       └── 2
│           └── 3
│               └── 4
│                   └── ...
└── shallow
    └── <strong>needle</strong>
</pre>

`find` will explore the entire `deep` directory tree before it ever gets to the `shallow` one that contains what you're looking for.

<pre>
$ <strong>find</strong> haystack
haystack
haystack/deep
haystack/deep/1
haystack/deep/1/2
haystack/deep/1/2/3
haystack/deep/1/2/3/4
...
haystack/shallow
<strong>haystack/shallow/needle</strong>
</pre>

On the other hand, `bfs` lists files from shallowest to deepest, so you never have to wait for it to explore an entire unrelated subtree.

<pre>
$ <strong>bfs</strong> haystack
haystack
haystack/deep
haystack/shallow
haystack/deep/1
<strong>haystack/shallow/needle</strong>
haystack/deep/1/2
haystack/deep/1/2/3
haystack/deep/1/2/3/4
...
</pre>


Easy
----

`bfs` tries to be easier to use than `find`, while remaining compatible.
For example, `bfs` is less picky about where you put its arguments:

<pre>
$ <strong>find</strong> -L -name 'needle' <em>haystack</em>
find: paths must precede expression: haystack
$ <strong>bfs</strong> -L -name 'needle' <em>haystack</em>
<strong>haystack/needle</strong>

$ <strong>find</strong> <em>haystack</em> -L -name 'needle'
find: unknown predicate `-L'
$ <strong>bfs</strong> <em>haystack</em> -L -name 'needle'
<strong>haystack/needle</strong>

$ <strong>find</strong> -L <em>haystack</em> -name 'needle'
<strong>haystack/needle</strong>
$ <strong>bfs</strong> -L <em>haystack</em> -name 'needle'
<strong>haystack/needle</strong>
</pre>

`bfs` also adds some extra options that make some common tasks easier.
Compare `bfs -nohidden` to `find -name '.?*' -prune -o -print`.


Pretty
------

When `bfs` detects that its output is a terminal, it automatically colors its output with the same colors `ls` uses.
This makes it easier to identify relevant files at a glance.

Try it!
-------

To get `bfs`, download one of the [releases](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/releases) or clone the [git repo](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs).
Then run

    $ make

This will build the `bfs` binary in the current directory.
You can test it out:

    $ ./bfs -nohidden

If you're interested in speed, you may want to build the release version instead:

    $ make clean
    $ make release

Finally, if you want to install it globally, run

    $ sudo make install

If you're on Arch Linux, `bfs` is available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bfs/).

If you're on Debian GNU/Linux, `bfs` is available via `apt-get install bfs`.

If you're on MacOS:

    $ brew tap tavianator/bfs
    $ brew install tavianator/bfs/bfs
