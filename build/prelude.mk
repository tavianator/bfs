# Common makefile utilities.  Compatible with both GNU make and most BSD makes.

.OBJDIR: .

# We don't use any suffix rules
.SUFFIXES:

# GNU make has $^ for the full list of targets, while BSD make has $> and the
# long-form ${.ALLSRC}.  We could write $^ $> to get them both, but that would
# break if one of them implemented support for the other.  So instead, bring
# BSD's ${.ALLSRC} to GNU.

# GNU and BSD make have incompatible syntax for conditionals, but we can do a
# lot with just nested variable expansion.  We use "y" as the canonical
# truthy value, and "" (the empty string) as the canonical falsey value.
#
# To normalize a boolean, use ${TRUTHY,${VAR}}, which expands like this:
#
#     VAR=y      ${TRUTHY,${VAR}} => ${TRUTHY,y}     => y
#     VAR=1      ${TRUTHY,${VAR}} => ${TRUTHY,1}     => y
#     VAR=n      ${TRUTHY,${VAR}} => ${TRUTHY,n}     =>   [empty]
#     VAR=other  ${TRUTHY,${VAR}} => ${TRUTHY,other} =>   [empty]
#     VAR=       ${TRUTHY,${VAR}} => ${TRUTHY,}      =>   [empty]
#
# Inspired by https://github.com/wahern/autoguess
TRUTHY,y := y
TRUTHY,1 := y

# Boolean operators are also implemented with nested expansion
NOT, := y

# Normalize ${V} to either "y" or ""
